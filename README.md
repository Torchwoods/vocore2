# Welcome

This feed enable using MTK/Ralink official wifi driver for the latest linux kernel 4.14/openwrt. It should be much stable than current mt76 driver. I patch it for my production VoCore2.

Feel free to submit patch and bug or email me at support@vocore.io

This patch is only for study/personal usage, and only for VoCore2, it might burn your house, launch nuke, etc... please use it carefully and risk is on you. 
Source code of mt7628 is from internet.


# Why use Linux 4.14

For faster speed and more security.


# How to use it

1. add this feeds to your openwrt source.

```
cd ~/openwrt
cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
echo src-git vocore2 https://github.com/vonger/vocore2.git >> feeds.conf
./scripts/feeds update vocore2
cp -r ./feeds/vocore2/mt7628 ./package/kernel
```

FIXME: I have no idea why `./scripts/feeds install -a -p vocore2` not work...

2. patch your openwrt with necessary patches to use this driver.

```
cd ~/openwrt
patch -p1 < ./package/kernel/mt7628/openwrt/000-*.patch

mkdir ./package/network/utils/iwinfo/patches
cp ./package/kernel/mt7628/openwrt/080-*.patch ./package/network/utils/iwinfo/patches
```


3. config mt7628 in `make menuconfig` Kernel modules -> Wireless Drivers -> kmod-mt7628

- Target System: MediaTek Ralink MIPS
- Subtarget: MT76x8 based boards
- Kernel modules -> Wireless Drivers -> unselect kmod-mt76 / select kmod-mt7628 -> select WiFi Operation Mode -> enable AP-Client support for AP+STA mode; enable SNIFFER for monitor mode.
- Base System -> select wireless-tools (need its iwpriv)
- Network(option): unselect wapd-mini/hostapd-common (mt7628.ko already have WPA support)
- Global build settings(option): Kernel build options -> /dev/mem virtual device support(enable /dev/mem for easy debug)
- Global build settings(option): unselect Cryptographically signed package lists (this will block compile)


4. compile and enjoy!

### Option

1. enable luci setting up AP+STA mode, WPA/WPA2. default: disable

install luci feeds first.

patch -p1 < ./package/kernel/mt7628/openwrt/luci/*.patch

# Known Issue + TODO

1. support mutilssid in **uci wireless config**.

2. support monitor in **uci wireless config**.

note: 1, 2 are supported already, check my blog at vonger.cn to get tutorial about how to make them work.


# Thank you

Thanks to all openwrt contributors! Hope we can make wireless more freedom and better :)
